Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun
Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of
Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference
implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class
libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the
specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had
relicensed most of its Java technologies under the
GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java
Virtual Machine, however the official reference
implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source
software and used by most developers and is the default JVM
for almost all Linux distributions.
