As of October 2021, Java 17 is the latest version. Java 8,
11 and 17 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.
Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the
legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial
use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with
public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors
have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11
that are still receiving security and other upgrades.
